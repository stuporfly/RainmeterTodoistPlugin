// Overview: This example demonstrates using both the data argument to keep data across
// functions calls and also storing data in the |Rainmeter.data| file for presist access across
// skin reloads and even measures. In this example we will make a counter that counts the number
// of updates that happen and saves it when the skin unloads to the |Rainmeter.data| file.
// Note: Remember that the Update function will not be called when the measure is paused or disabled.

//Sample skin:
/*
	[Rainmeter]
	Update=1000
	DynamicWindowSize=1
	BackgroundMode=2
	SolidColor=255,255,255

	[mCount]
	Measure=Plugin
	Plugin=DataHandling
	SaveData=1

	[mCountAt0]
	Measure=Plugin
	Plugin=DataHandling
	StartingValue=0

	[MeterCount]
	Meter=String
	MeasureName=mCount

	[MeterCountAt0]
	Meter=String
	MeasureName=mCountAt0
	Y=5R
